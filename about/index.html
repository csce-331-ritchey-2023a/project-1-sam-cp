            My name is Sam Prewett, and I'm a junior at Texas A&M University with a major in Computer Engineering and a minor in Mathematics.
            When I'm not doing schoolwork, I work for the university's Department of Computer Science & Engineering
            as a Teaching Assistant for the Data Structures and Algorithms course.
            This summer, I will be interning for Emerson Electric Co. as a Software Engineer in their Process Systems and Solutions division.

            I began programming when I was in elementary school.
            I started with simple web design, using tools like Apple's iWeb to make webpages and experimenting with editing the HTML.
            I decided to learn JavaScript to make my webpages more interactive, and I found the logic and structure of making simple scripts very intriguing.
            My dad is an Electrical Engineer, and he was a great influence on my interest in math and programming.
            He showed me tools like RapidWeaver, which let me explore even more about web design.
            I would go on in middle school to take summer camps about programming languages, namely Java and C, as well as many about robotics.
            Additionally, I learned how to use Swift to write iOS applications, and I even published a few to the App Store (which are, sadly, no longer available).
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was applying to colleges, I decided that I wanted to make my passion into my career, and chose to apply for a Computer Engineering major.
            I was accepted into Texas A&M, which was my dream school (as both of my parents went there), into the College of Engineering.
            Since I've been at A&M, I've learned other languages, such as C++ and Python, and have learned how to make much more complex software.
        </p>

            I began working for the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in Fall 2022 as a <a target="_blank" href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/academics/peer-teachers/index.html">Peer Teacher</a>, where I would assist TAs in lab sections; 
            hold office hours for students in various courses; and host weekly review sessions, both for an introductory C++ course and a Discrete Math course.
            In the Spring of 2023, I began working as a Teaching Assistant for the Data Structures and Algorithms course.

            Outside of school and work, I'm involved with my church, including taking part in various service projects. 
            Additionally I serve as the president of a student organization, <a target="_blank" href="http://rc-tamu.org/">Ratio Christi</a>, which serves to 
            promote the intellectual side of the Christian faith, particularly by helping both Christians and those of other faiths/worldviews 
            learn about Christian apologetics, as well as by facilitating respectful inter-faith dialogue. 
            I also love music, and I play guitar, as well as some piano and bass. 
            Additionally, I am interested in digital art, and I sometimes use Blender to make different animations and images (including the background of my <a href="../">landing page</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            This summer, I'll be a Software Engineering Intern for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.emerson.com/en-us/automation-solutions">Emerson Automation Solutions</a> in Round Rock, TX, and I'm excited to get to experience
            how software development works outside the walls of the university and of my own personal projects.
